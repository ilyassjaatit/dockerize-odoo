## MailHog for Debugging Transactional Email Delivery
We have integrated the MailHog tool within a Docker container to simplify testing and debugging of transactional email delivery. MailHog allows us to capture and view the emails generated by Odoo without actually sending them to real recipients.

This streamlines our development process and enables us to verify the generation and content of emails without impacting end users.


### Accessing the MailHog Web Interface
To access the MailHog web interface, open your web browser and visit the following URL: http://localhost:8025. From there, you can view the MailHog inbox and inspect the captured emails sent from Odoo.

In the web interface, you can inspect the emails, check fields such as "From," "To," "Subject," "Body," and ensure that the emails generated by Odoo meet your expectations.

## Commands to test odoo quickly

##### 1. install odoo with an addon and start the server
This same command can be used to install other modules or initialize the database with a specific addon
```bash
# 
git clone git@github.com:ilyassjaatit/OCB.git --single-branch  src-odoo -b 16.0

# Initial odoo without any addon
docker compose run --rm odoo /bin/bash /start -i base --stop-after-init
